Hi Everyone, This is one of the projects that I have done in my Diploma (Computer System Design) second-semester Object-Oriented Subject. 

here we have built a simple food ordering system with delivery using OOP concepts. 

To run this you need to have Codeblocks(recommended) installed on your computer.

First, you have to select the menu and quantity. After that, you will be asked to print out the recipt for the customer. After that you can add delivery information and the system will print the final receipt with delivery charge.
